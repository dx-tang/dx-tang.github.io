%\section{System Building Experience}
%
%\system{Multi-Query Optimization in SparkSQL}
%{I extend SparkSQL to support multi-query optimization for the full TPC-H test suite. 
%The framework takes Dataframe queries as input and generates a query plan 
%that shares the execution of all submitted queries. 
%I enhance each intermediate tuple during query execution to 
%additionally include the query IDs that the tuple is valid to 
%and modify SparkSQL operators to leverage this information 
%to support shared query execution.}
%
%\system{Complex Materialized View Maintenance in SparkSQL}
%{I extend SparkSQL to support maintaining materialized views with deletes and updates.
%The system supports complex materialized views that are beyond select-project-join-aggregate queries. 
%Specifically, the supported operators include select, project, aggregate, sort, materialize, distinct, 
%and joins (inner, outer, and anti join), and there is no ordering limit about these operators.}
%
%\system{Intermediate State Management in \pg}
%{I extend \pg to support materialized view maintenance with intermediate state management. 
%The modified \pg can selectively discard some intermediate states to save memory resources. 
%When a discarded state is required to process new data, the system can rebuild this state from saved intermediate states 
%to quickly update the materialized view.
%}
%
%\system{Adaptive Concurrency Control in Main-Memory Database}
%{I develop a key-value main-memory database which hosts several concurrency control protocols 
%including partition-based concurrency control, two-phase locking, and optimistic concurrency control protocols. 
%The database uses a machine learning model to adaptively apply a protocol to a partition of the database 
%and reconfigures protocols in response to workload changes.}

\section{Recent Research Projects (Detailed Descriptions)}

\projectWithNum{Data Shift Explaination}{Sep. 2021-Present}
{ShiftXplain is a framework for explaining data shift. 
Data shift is ubiquitous in real-world datasets 
due to the natural evolution in the underlying data 
relationships and patterns, often leading to a degradation 
of the performance of data-dependent applications (e.g., an ML model). 
ShiftXplain explains the data shift 
between two datasets using a conjunction of predicates 
and proposes a novel metric, shiftIndex, to capture 
both general and unique shift patterns. 
More importantly, shiftIndex is partially monotonic and bounded, 
which is leveraged by our search algorithm to efficiently 
prune the search space without sacrificing the explanation quality.}

\projectWithNumUrl{FormS: A Python Library for Scalable Spreadsheet Formula Execution}{Mar. 2022-Jun. 2023}
{https://github.com/forms-org/forms}
{FormS is a Python library for executing spreadsheet formulae 
in a distributed execution framework. 
In FormS, users write a list of formulae 
via a formula template based on autofill rules, 
as widely supported by today's spreadsheet systems. 
For example, applying a template \form{SUM(A1:A2,B\$1:B2)} 
to a column will generate $[\form{SUM(A1:A2,B\$1:B2)}, 
\form{SUM(A2:A3,B\$1:B3)}, \cdots]$, where the first range 
is generated similar to a sliding window while the 
second one is similar to an expanding window in databases. 
While a formula template is similar to a window operator in databases, 
efficiently executing a list of formulae is challenging 
due to two unique semantics in spreadsheets: 
1) each spreadsheet function may accept multiple windows with different sizes and types; 
2) spreadsheets support many functions that are not optimized by 
databases (e.g., \form{SUMIF} function) and require 
new optimizations to execute them efficiently. 
To address these challenges, I proposed novel logical and physical 
rewriting rules for executing a list of formulae 
efficiently in parallel. 
FormS now has support for over 50 popular spreadsheet functions; 
I am mentoring a few undergrads to support more functions 
for a public release. }

\projectWithNumUrl{Transactional Panorama: Enhancing User Perception in Analytical Interfaces}{Sep. 2021-Jun. 2023}
{https://github.com/transactional-panorama/TP}
{I developed transactional panorama, 
a conceptual framework for user perception when the visualizations 
in a visual analytical interface (e.g., a dashboard or spreadsheet) 
are being refreshed. In such an interface, it is common 
for users to modify the source data or filters 
to explore different visualization results. 
With large datasets, it takes a long time to 
refresh the visualization results 
while users continue to explore the results simultaneously. 
In this context, existing tools either (i) hide away
results that haven't been updated, hindering exploration;
(ii) make the updated results immediately available to the user
(on the same screen as old results), leading to confusion 
and incorrect insights; or (iii) present old---and therefore 
stale---results to the user during the update. 
I developed transactional panorama to 
discover new options for users 
and help users make appropriate trade-offs between 
the properties guaranteed for the visual results 
and the performance for presenting the updated results. 
Transactional panorama adopts database transactions 
to jointly model the system refreshing the visualization results 
and the user interacting with them, 
and considers three properties that are important for 
user perception: visibility (allowing users to continuously 
explore results), consistency (ensuring that results 
presented are from the same version of the data or filters), 
and monotonicity (making sure that results 
don't ``go back in time''). 
I characterized all feasible property combinations, 
formally proved their relative orderings for various 
performance criteria (e.g., the total time when 
the user sees stale results), and discussed their use cases. 
With transactional panorama, the user can explore 
visual results with desired properties guaranteed 
while the visual interface is being refreshed.}

\projectWithNumUrl{Taco: Efficient and Compact Spreadsheet Formula Graphs}{Jan. 2021-Jun. 2023}
{https://github.com/taco-org/taco}
{Taco is a framework for efficiently compressing, querying, 
and maintaining spreadsheet formula graphs to reduce the response time of spreadsheets. 
A formula graph is adopted to track the dependencies across spreadsheet formulae. 
When a spreadsheet cell is modified, the spreadsheet system needs to query the formula graph 
to find its dependents and calculate new formula results. 
Identifying dependents quickly is key to ensuring that 
users don't see stale or inconsistent results, and also helps spreadsheets return control early to users. 
Therefore, I proposed Taco to compress the formula graph by leveraging a key property, tabular locality, 
which means that cells close to each other are likely to have similar formula structures. 
Based on the analysis of real-world spreadsheets, 
I identified five tabular locality-based patterns 
and designed novel algorithms for querying the compressed 
representation without decompression. 
Our experiments on real-world spreadsheets show 
that the speedup of Taco over Excel on finding dependents 
is up to 632$\times$.}

\projectWithNumUrl{Modin: A Scalable Dataframe System}{Jan. 2021-Present}
{https://github.com/modin-project/modin}
{I led the effort in developing two key techniques 
for efficient parallel execution and metadata management in Modin.
Pandas is a popular dataframe library widely embraced by data scientists and has been 
the defacto tool for doing exploratory data analysis in Python. 
However, building a scalable dataframe system 
that maintains the unique semantics of dataframes 
(e.g., supporting mixed types of data in a column 
and requiring a specific row order for 
the output dataframe of a function) 
and supports a large number of pandas functions (i.e., over 600) 
is challenging. Modin addresses the challenges by mapping pandas functions 
to 15 core operators, and efficiently parallelizing 
the core operators and managing the associated metadata 
(e.g., the type information per column). 
Specifically, I formally developed decomposition rules 
that decompose the execution of a core operator 
in row-wise, column-wise, and cell-wise ways 
to parallelize the core operator 
while maintaining its unique semantics. 
I then developed rewriting rules to 
choose the decomposition rules for efficient parallel execution. 
For efficient metadata management, 
I proposed metadata independence, 
a technique that always logically maintains the metadata 
and lazily materializes the metadata when necessary. 
Modin has been adopted by many data scientists 
to accelerate their pandas execution. 
It has more than 7K daily downloads and 8K stars on GitHub.}

\projectWithNumUrl{Lux: Always-on Visualization Recommendations}{Jan. 2021-Present}
{https://github.com/lux-org/lux}
{Lux is a visualization recommendation tool to reduce the programming overhead for generating visualizations. 
It proposes a novel data-centered intent language that 
allows users to use attributes and filters to specify the portion of data of interest 
without having to consider the visualization encodings, which are inferred by Lux automatically. 
In addition, Lux models the recommendation process as a state machine, 
where the state space is defined by the possible combinations 
of attributes and filters and each recommendation moves users from the current state to an adjacent one. 
For example, if a user specifies the intent on two attributes and we consider the attribute space, 
Lux will visualize the relationship between the two attributes 
(e.g., using a scatter plot) and additionally consider the visualizations that remove, add, or swap one 
of the original two attributes as candidates. For the candidate visualizations to be recommended, 
Lux ranks them based on pre-defined interestingness scores and choosees the top $k$ visualizations,

\projectWithNum{Client-Assisted Data Loading}{July 2019-Dec. 2020}
{Data loading is time-consuming due to type parsing,  
integrity checking, and maintaining data structures. 
I mentored an undergraduate to leverage 
lazy data loading to make data quickly available 
without heavily sacrificing query performance. 
The idea is actively pushing predicates of prospective queries into 
the clients (e.g. edge devices) 
to generate bit-vectors that indicate whether a tuple 
is valid for a predicate. 
The system leverages the bit vectors 
to partially load data that is most frequently 
accessed by prospective queries. 
When queries access unloaded data, 
the system uses the bit-vectors as an index 
to accelerate the query execution by skipping irrelevant tuples.}

\projectWithNumUrl{\db: Resource-Efficient Database Execution}{Nov. 2017-Mar. 2021}
{https://github.com/orgs/crocodiledb/repositories}
{Scalable data systems, while performant, 
consume many computing and memory resources, 
introducing a high monetary cost if run on the cloud. 
I built a resource-efficient database, \db, 
to reduce resource usage while meeting a performance goal. 
% by re-architecting the query execution engine 
% and memory management in the database. 
\db supports scheduled queries 
over a stream of tuples (e.g., ETL jobs or recurring dashboard reports) 
and the performance goal is the maximally allowed query latency, 
which is defined as the time between when the full data 
is ready for one scheduled query (i.e., the last tuple arrives)
and the query result is computed. 
The core idea for reducing resource consumption 
is regarding the performance goal as a time slackness 
and designing novel system strategies 
to exploit the slackness, including 1) selectively 
executing parts of a scheduled query lazily, 
2) judiciously deciding the queries to share, and 
3) intelligently choosing the intermediate states 
(e.g., a hash table for a hash join) to maintain in memory.  
Parts of the techniques in \db are adopted 
in a system in Alibaba for reducing the resource 
consumption of recurring jobs for daily reports. 

Specifically, I developed \incability-aware query processing, 
or \inqp, for reducing the CPU consumption 
for one scheduled query. To reduce the query latency 
and meet the performance goal, 
incremental execution is employed to compute the partial results 
early and incrementally maintain the previous results. 
The more eagerly we incrementally execute a query (e.g., perform 
one incremental execution for each new tuple), 
the higher query work and subsequent CPU consumption 
there will be, mainly because output tuples in earlier executions 
may be removed by later executions, increasing the query work. 
Interestingly, eager incremental execution of different parts of a query 
will increase different amounts of query work for 
the same amount of reduced latency. 
Therefore, I proposed \incability, a novel metric for quantifying the 
cost-effectiveness of incremental execution 
for different parts of a query, 
and developed an algorithm for incrementally executing 
different sub-queries at different levels of eagerness 
based on their \incability 
to reduce total query work while meeting the performance goal. 

Next, I developed iShare, 
which selectively shares queries 
that execute on the same data and have different performance goals. 
Shared execution eliminates redundant computation to save CPU
cycles. However, shared execution for different performance goals 
requires the shared plan to meet the hardest goal (i.e., 
the lowest latency constraint) and forces some participating queries 
to run more eagerly. Eager incremental execution 
increases total query work, which may offset the benefits 
of shared execution. iShare considers the two factors
together and finds efficient query plans that reduce 
redundant work across concurrent queries and avoid the cost of 
eager incremental execution.

Finally, I developed intermittent query processing, 
or \iqp, for reducing memory consumption. 
Our observation is that the new data for a scheduled query 
may arrive intermittently, rather than continuously in some cases. 
Therefore, there may be a long time when the query does not  
incorporate new data. During this period, 
\iqp selectively discards parts of the intermediate 
states to reduce memory consumption with respect to a memory budget 
and recomputes them from other saved intermediate states when necessary. 
I proposed an algorithm to decide which intermediate states 
to discard to best reduce the query latency 
based on the predictive information about the new data, 
such as the estimated size and 
distribution of the base tables having new data.}

\projectWithNumUrl{Adaptive Concurrency Control for Main-Memory Databases}{Sep. 2015-Nov. 2017}
{https://github.com/dx-tang/cc-testbed}
{I built a main-memory database that adaptively mixes 
multiple concurrency control protocols, where each protocol is optimized for 
a different type of workload. I implemented multiple protocols, developed a machine learning model to 
predict the ideal protocol for a workload, and developed a mediated protocol for switching protocols online. 
Our experimental results show that this approach has much higher transaction throughput than 
the best single protocol under varied workloads. }
