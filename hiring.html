<b>I am seeking Ph.D. students with a strong background and/or interest in system research,
    especially around data systems.</b> Students with backgrounds in database systems, distributed systems, key-value stores, GPU programming, or cloud computing are highly encouraged to apply.
    Given the interdisciplinary nature of my work,
    students with experience in programming languages and machine learning are 
    also encouraged to apply. Please follow the instructions 
    <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/graduate-program/prospective-students/apply">here</a> 
    to submit an applicaiton. Note that the UTCS information on 
    <a href="http://www.applytexas.org">www.applytexas.org</a> may be outdated.
    So when asked about choosing a research area, "databases" may not be in the options. 
    In that case, please choose a nearest research area, which will not impact the application.

<!--
<p class="text-justify">
At UTCS, a Ph.D. application will be reviewed by the CS department and individual professors who express interest in the application. I evaluate applications based on four factors:
		<p class="text-justify">
		<b>Curiosity.</b> I believe an outstanding Ph.D. student will always ask questions about their and others’ research and set out to answer these questions, driven by their innate curiosity rather than their advisor. For example, it is common to encounter an unexpected experiment result, in which case the student will try to unravel its intricacies by repeatedly asking and answering many mini-questions, leading to the final answer. </p>

		<p class="text-justify">
		<b>Resilience.</b> Conducting research is inherently challenging as we will venture into uncharted territories and do things that nobody has done. Consequently, encountering hurdles and difficulties, such as bad experimental results or negative reviews, is inevitable. In my opinion, a successful Ph.D. student should quickly recover from such setbacks and find ways to overcome them. Of course, talking to one's advisor is always helpful in these situations.</p>

		<p class="text-justify">
		<b>Communication.</b> Good communication skills are crucial to a successful Ph.D. career. While communication skills will be trained throughout the Ph.D. program, I expect prospective students can communicate their ideas clearly and logically about the things they are familiar with, such as the projects they have worked on or basic CS concepts.</p>		

		<p class="text-justify">
		<b>Engineering.</b>
		Being system researchers, substantiating the effectiveness of our research ideas requires building a software system from scratch or implementing these ideas in an existing system, which requires a significant amount of engineering effort. I hope my students have the courage to tackle non-trivial engineering challenges and are willing to refine their engineering skills in the process.
		</p>

	 	<p class="text-justify">
		Having said that, if you find yourself without particularly strong application materials (e.g., not having top-tier publications or reference letters from renowned researchers), yet firmly believe you excel in the four key aspects mentioned earlier, I encourage you to apply! I will select a substantial pool of candidates to talk to, and the decision will be based on a comprehensive evaluation of the application materials and the one-on-one meetings.
		</p>
-->
		
<!--		
		<p class="text-justify">
		Finally, for students who feel their application is not strong enough but want to impress me, please try one of the following projects (or their simplified versions) independently:  </p>
		<ul class="text-justify" style="padding-left:15px;margin:0px;margin-bottom:15px">
			<li>Fully support inner, outer, semi, and anti joins in <a href="https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/structured-streaming-programming-guide.html", target="_blank">Spark Structured Streaming</a>. By “fully”, I mean these operators are stateful and support both inserting new tuples and deleting old tuples on their input streams.</li>
			
			<li>Support incremental executions for select, project, equi join, and aggregation operators in <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/", target="_blank">PostgreSQL</a>. You can assume the changes to the base tables are insert-only. The codebase of PostgreSQL is well-documented, and hacking its execution engine is doable.
			</li>
			
			<li>Implement the <a href="https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~paris/cs784-f19/lectures/lecture4.pdf", target="_blank">Yannakakis algorithm</a> in PostgreSQL, use the <a href="https://www.tpc.org/tpc_documents_current_versions/current_specifications5.asp", target="_blank">TPC-H</a> benchmark to compare its performance with the plans generated by PostgreSQL’s default query optimizer, and explain the experimental results.
			</li>
			
			<li>Implement a parallel dataframe system that provides the same interface as <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/", target="_blank">pandas</a> but is faster than <a href="https://github.com/modin-project/modin", target="_blank">Modin</a> and explain the experiment results. You can select a subset of pandas functions to implement.
			</li>
			
			<li>Implement a system that allows users to adopt <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/office/excel-functions-by-category-5f91f4e9-7b42-46d2-9bd1-63f26a86c0eb", target="_blank">spreadsheet formulas</a> to analyze the data stored in PostgreSQL and optimize the performance of formula executions. You can select a subset of spreadsheet formulas to implement. Do not worry about the UI. Providing a command line or Python interface is enough.
			</li>
